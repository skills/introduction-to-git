## Step 6: Introduction to Collaboration

Nice work! You've mastered local Git operations and our game is now safe to experiment developing new features! 🎉

But.. the fun development happens in teams, not alone. That is another exercise, but let's start exploring the topic.

### 📖 Theory: Git Collaboration Concepts

Since branches provide powerful parallelism to work on different features independently, a natural extension is to enable multiple people to work in parallel.

At the beginning, we mentioned Git is a "distributed" version control system, this means it can share changes with other repositories!

### What does collaboration look like?

Here is a typical workflow.

1. Copy a repository to your local machine.
1. Create branches and develop new features.
1. Publish your changes to a remote repository, somewhere others can also access.
1. Other developers decide if they like your changes. If so, they merge them into their version of the project.
   - Additionally, you may proactively ask another developer to integrate your changes into their copy. This is commonly called a "Pull Request" or "Merge Request".

**What is your favorite feature of Git?**

- [ ] It's free and open source.
- [ ] I don't need the internet to use it.
- [ ] I can use it from any operating system.
- [ ] The detailed history (if I write good messages).
- [ ] That I might never write `final_really.zip` ever again!
